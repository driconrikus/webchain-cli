## About

Emerald Console is a tool to access Ethereum blockchain(s) from the command line. It connects to an 
external node (_"upstream"_) and allows a user or application to read information from the blockchain and to send new 
transactions. In the latter case it provides functionality to sign transactions by a provided Private Key. The tool 
integrates [emerald-rs](https://github.com/ETCDEVTeam/emerald-rs) with the intention of generation, import, and/or 
storing of Ethereum Private Keys.

Emerald Console is compatible with:
 
 - Ethereum Classic ETC
 - Ethereum ETH
 - Rootstock
 - Ropsten Testnet
 - Morden Testnet
 - Rinkeby Testnet
 - Rootstock Testnet
